# Trees
A tree data structure is a non-linear data structure because it does not store in a sequential manner
## Challenge
- Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the node, the left child node, and the right child node.
- Create a Binary Tree class with three methods:
    1) pre order
    2) in order
    3) post order 
- Create a Binary Search Tree class with 2 methods 
    1) Add
    2) Contains
## Approach & Efficiency
- traversal method used to solve it. 
## API
pre order: root>left>right
in order : left > root > right
post order : left > right > root 
add : adding a new node
contains: check if a value inside the tree
