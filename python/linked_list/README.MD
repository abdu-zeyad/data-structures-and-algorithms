# Singly Linked List

    Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node.
    Linked List
    Create a Linked List class
    Within your Linked List class, include a head property.
    Upon instantiation, an empty Linked List should be created.

## Challenge

    he head property will properly point to the first node in the linked list
    Can properly insert multiple nodes into the linked list
    Will return true when finding a value within the linked list that exists

## Approach & Efficiency

    I used  the normal implementation for linked list. 

## API

    no API is used.
